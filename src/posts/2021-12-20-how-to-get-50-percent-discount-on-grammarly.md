From working with different marketing teams I was able to learn that usually a service would wants to grab users at any cost if the user didn't pass the first sales funnel.


With that while browsing [grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) I have tried the following for multiple times and it has worked without any problems.


The process is easy and as follow:

1. The process would only work for indviduals accounts
2. Navigate to Grammarly to buy a subscription for individuals accounts
3. Login/Create an account if you don't have one already
4. Navigate to the checkout page and fill some information but don't press on the checkout button
5. Close the checkout page
6. Go to your email inbox and wait for an email from Grammarly
7. In the email you will receive a link that gives you a 50% discount


```
If the process didn't work please contact me so I can support you.
