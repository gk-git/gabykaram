I couldn't believe myself that I have asked the below question to one of my clients, 

What is the urgency of the problem that you have? 

I could need 3 weeks to deliver and I could lose internet for days if something has happened in Lebanon(the Lebanese government is a mafia that has been controlling Lebanon for the past 30 years and in 3 weeks the country is having an election and these type of rulers would do anything to keep them in control with the country, they could start a 1 week or more of closing streets on everyone who just wants to transport from a point a to a point b including cutting the lines of the internet because another area would suffer).
