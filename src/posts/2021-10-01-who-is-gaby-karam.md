I don’t find myself defined by who I am currently. I'define myself by what I am looking to be.

Skills are teachable, and personality is inherent. My character is what separates me from others. I can chase awards, status, or gaining accolades. I continue challenging myself, do [exciting things](https://gabykaram.com//work) that matter, and [write about them](https://gabykaram.com/blog).

I’m the cumulation of many skills and talents. I enjoy working with clients who do contribute to the social mission field, want to do an impact, become sustainable, and leave a mark. The value of my work is reflected in the impact I have on the communities that I join.
