Your support ensures that students have access to books, teachers have access to resources, scholars have access to research, and that everyone has access to the web’s memory.

I hope you stay engaged with the Internet Archive! One great way is to subscribe to "Internet Archive Org" monthly newsletter, where you can keep up to date with the latest Archive news and explore hidden gems inside our vast collections. Visit [archive.org/subscribe](archive.org/subscribe) to sign up.

Do you work for a company that matches employee contributions? You can make your generosity go even farther! Visit blog.archive.org/matching-gifts to search for your employer’s corporate matching program and multiply your gift’s impact.

Last but not least, the simplest way to support us is by using the Archive and spreading the word to your friends and family. Since "Internet Archive Org" is a small team and they don’t run ads, word of mouth is one of our community most powerful tools for building the library of the future.

Thank you again for your kind support. Together, we are ensuring Universal Access To All Knowledge.

With much gratitude,

The Internet Archive Team
